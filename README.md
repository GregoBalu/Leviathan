# Leviathan
A digital GameBook.

# What's a GameBook?
A GameBook was originally a written literal book which contained an interactive adventure to read and play through. Much like an RPG computer game nowadays, it started with you (the reader) creating his/her character of choice. Then the player started on the first page, with the the pharagraph marked with '1'. Every story piece - paragraph - was numbered and every piece contained a choice at it's end, for example whether the player wanted to go left or right then he/she should have turned to the section numbered as requested.
The reader even could replay the story choosing a different character and choosing different paths in the story, reliving different adventures.

# What is Leviathan?
The project Leviathan first started as a simple digital GameBook, where a player could venture forth on a journey where he/she choose the paths he/she wanted. After the initial concept I developed a prototype which was functional, but I wanted to create the story itself. To do that I created a number of applications so I could easily assemble the adventure. It was then when I thought that this could be even more flexible and I tried to extract as much restrictions from the code to outer sources as I could, so anyone who had a good idea can use the 'framework' and make a new GameBook of his/her own.
This project is just a hobby. I don't have neither the time nor the resources to work on it a lot, but I work on it for my own fun and interest.
